To calculate the expected value of each bet type for the Missouri Pick 3 lottery, we need to consider:
1. The probability of winning each type of bet.
2. The payout for each type of bet.
3. The cost of each type of bet.

The **expected value** (EV) for a bet is the average amount you can expect to win per dollar bet. It's calculated as:
\[
\text{EV} = (\text{Probability of Win} \times \text{Payout}) - \text{Cost of Bet}
\]

Letâ€™s go through each type of bet.

### 1. $1 Straight Bet
- **Winning Condition**: Guess all three digits in exact order.
- **Total Possible Outcomes**: There are \(10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000\) possible outcomes.
- **Probability of Winning**: \( \frac{1}{1000} \)
- **Payout**: $600
- **Expected Value**:
  \[
  \text{EV} = \frac{1}{1000} \times 600 - 1 = 0.6 - 1 = -0.4
  \]
  So, the expected value for a $1 Straight Bet is **-$0.40** per dollar bet.

### 2. $1 Front Pair Bet
- **Winning Condition**: Guess the first two digits correctly (any last digit).
- **Total Possible Outcomes for Front Pair**: \(10 \times 10 = 100\)
- **Probability of Winning**: \( \frac{10}{1000} = \frac{1}{100} \)
- **Payout**: $60
- **Expected Value**:
  \[
  \text{EV} = \frac{1}{100} \times 60 - 1 = 0.6 - 1 = -0.4
  \]
  So, the expected value for a $1 Front Pair Bet is **-$0.40** per dollar bet.

### 3. $1 Back Pair Bet
- **Winning Condition**: Guess the last two digits correctly (any first digit).
- **Total Possible Outcomes for Back Pair**: \(10 \times 10 = 100\)
- **Probability of Winning**: \( \frac{1}{100} \)
- **Payout**: $60
- **Expected Value**:
  \[
  \text{EV} = \frac{1}{100} \times 60 - 1 = 0.6 - 1 = -0.4
  \]
  So, the expected value for a $1 Back Pair Bet is **-$0.40** per dollar bet.

### 4. $6 6-Way Combo Bet
- **Winning Condition**: All three digits are different, and you guess them in any order.
- **Possible Outcomes with 3 Unique Digits**: There are \(10 \times 9 \times 8 = 720\) ways to choose three different digits.
- **Winning Arrangements**: For each set of three unique digits, there are \(3! = 6\) ways to arrange them.
- **Probability of Winning**: \( \frac{6}{1000} = \frac{3}{500} \)
- **Payout**: $600
- **Cost of Bet**: $6
- **Expected Value**:
  \[
  \text{EV} = \frac{3}{500} \times 600 - 6 = 3.6 - 6 = -2.4
  \]
  So, the expected value for a $6 6-Way Combo Bet is **-$2.40** per dollar bet.

### 5. $3 3-Way Combo Bet
- **Winning Condition**: Two digits are the same, and you guess all three digits in any order.
- **Possible Outcomes with Two Digits the Same**: There are \(10 \times 9 = 90\) combinations where two digits are the same.
- **Winning Arrangements**: For each set, there are 3 unique arrangements.
- **Probability of Winning**: \( \frac{3}{1000} \)
- **Payout**: $600
- **Cost of Bet**: $3
- **Expected Value**:
  \[
  \text{EV} = \frac{3}{1000} \times 600 - 3 = 1.8 - 3 = -1.2
  \]
  So, the expected value for a $3 3-Way Combo Bet is **-$1.20** per dollar bet.

### 6. $1 1-Off Bet
This bet pays differently based on how close the guess is. We need to account for each payout scenario.

#### Scenarios:
- **Exact Match**: Probability \( \frac{1}{1000} \), payout $300.
  \[
  \text{EV}_{\text{Exact}} = \frac{1}{1000} \times 300 = 0.3
  \]

- **One Digit Off by 1**: There are 3 digits, each with 2 possible "1-off" values, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) combinations.
  - **Probability**: \( \frac{6}{1000} = \frac{3}{500} \)
  - **Payout**: $29
  \[
  \text{EV}_{\text{One Off}} = \frac{3}{500} \times 29 = 0.174
  \]

- **Two Digits Off by 1**: Choose 2 of the 3 digits, each with 2 possible "1-off" values, so \( \binom{3}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 12\) combinations.
  - **Probability**: \( \frac{12}{1000} = \frac{3}{250} \)
  - **Payout**: $4
  \[
  \text{EV}_{\text{Two Off}} = \frac{3}{250} \times 4 = 0.048
  \]

- **All Three Digits Off by 1**: Only 1 way this can happen.
  - **Probability**: \( \frac{1}{1000} \)
  - **Payout**: $9
  \[
  \text{EV}_{\text{Three Off}} = \frac{1}{1000} \times 9 = 0.009
  \]

#### Total Expected Value for $1 1-Off Bet:
\[
\text{Total EV} = 0.3 + 0.174 + 0.048 + 0.009 - 1 = -0.469
\]

The expected value for a $1 1-Off Bet is **-$0.47** per dollar bet.

### Summary of Expected Values:
1. **$1 Straight Bet**: -$0.40
2. **$1 Front Pair Bet**: -$0.40
3. **$1 Back Pair Bet**: -$0.40
4. **$6 6-Way Combo Bet**: -$2.40
5. **$3 3-Way Combo Bet**: -$1.20
6. **$1 1-Off Bet**: -$0.47

These expected values show that, on average, you will lose money with each of these bets. The best odds (least negative EV) are with the Straight, Front Pair, and Back Pair bets.
