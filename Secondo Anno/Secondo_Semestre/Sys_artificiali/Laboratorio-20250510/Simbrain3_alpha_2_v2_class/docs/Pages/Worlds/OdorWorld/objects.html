  <h1>Objects</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../../Images/Swiss.gif" width="32" height="32"> Objects and Walls in the Odor World are stationary entities. They act as olfactory stimuli, which emit chemicals which disperse from the center of the object and for the most part diminish with distance. Thus, objects act as a broadcasting center for a unique stimulus patterns, much like how a fine brie cheese disperses its odor around itself. How the signal disperses is based on a <a href="entitydialog.html#StimulusDispersion">decay function</a> associated with that particular object, and a vector of stimulus values. </p>
  <p class="heading">Stimulus Dimensions</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>All objects broadcast customizable stimulus patterns during each iteration. These patterns are defined by a list of stimulus values and a decay function. The number of stimulus dimensions (numbers in the list of stimulus values) is set by default to 8. These stimulus patterns are designed to be sensed by an <a href="agents.html">agent</a> when a neuron is coupled with it. A sensor can only receive  one dimension of a stimulus pattern at a time, so, each stimulus value of an object is completely independent of other stimulus values.  Stimulus values are set in the <a href="entitydialog.html">Entity Dialogue</a></p>

  <p class="heading">Miscellaneous Features</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="heading2">Edibility</span>: Objects have the ability to become <em>Edible</em>. This means that if an agent comes blocked by the object at hand, it will take some amount of iterations for the agent to eat the object. The number of iterations it takes for the object to become eaten is set by the <em>Bites to die</em> parameter.</p>
    <p><span class="heading2">Resurrection</span>: Objects also have the ability to be resurrected after it has been eaten by an agent. For each iteration after death, there will be some probability that the object will return to the Odor World. This probability is set by the <em>Resurrection Probability</em> parameter.
