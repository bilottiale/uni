<h1>Connecting Neurons<br>
</h1><br>
<p>Perhaps one of the most essential parts of building a network aside
from creating the neurons is connecting those neurons to other neurons
(and sometimes the same neurons). Connections embody the GUI component
of <a href="./synapse.html">synapses</a> in Simbrain, and therefore
graphically allow the one to manipulate the parameters of the synapses
connecting one set of neurons to another. In addition to granting
access to underlying synapses, connections and their related GUI
components allow one to determine the topology of how (out of a
multitude of ways) one set of neurons can connect to another. In the
side menu are pages dedicated to each of the standard ways neurons can
be connected in Simbrain.
</p>
<br>

<p class="heading"><a name="sourceTarget"></a>Source and Target Neurons<br>
</p>

<blockquote>Varous commands in Simbrain (e.g: connecing nodes, training
weights, viewing weight matrices) require you to specify a set of
source and target neurons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Source neurons are surrounded by
red squares and target neurons are surrounded by the standard green
selection squares.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is an example.<br>
  <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 253px; height: 184px;" alt="source / target neurons" src="../../Images/sourceTarget.png"><br>
  </div>
  <br>
  <span class="heading2">To set target neurons</span>: simply select as usual<br>
  <span class="heading2">To set source neurons</span>: select a group of neurons and either (1) press the "1" key, (2) right click and select&nbsp;<span class="command">Connect &gt; Set Source Neuron(s)</span>, or (3) use the Edit menu and select&nbsp;<span class="command">Connect &gt; Set Source Neuron(s)</span>.<br>
  <span class="heading2">To clear all source neurons</span>: unselect all neurons (but clicking outside of any neuron), and (1) press the "1" key or  (2) right click and select&nbsp;<span class="command">Connect &gt; Set Source Neuron(s)</span>, or (3) use the Edit menu and select&nbsp;<span class="command">Connect &gt; Set Source Neuron(s)</span>.<br>
  <span class="heading2">To clear specific source neurons</span>: select the neurons of interest and (1) right click and select&nbsp;<span class="command">Connect &gt; Clear Source Neuron(s)</span>, or (2) use the Edit menu and select&nbsp;<span class="command">Connect &gt; Clear Source Neuron(s)</span>.<br>

  <br>
Note that the same neurons can be source and target neurons.<br>

<p class="heading"><a name="ConnectNodes"></a>Connecting nodes.</p>

<blockquote><br>
  <span class="heading2">Keyboard shortcut method</span><br>
  <br>
To quckly connect neurons:<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Set source neurons (select and then keyboard 1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Set target neurons (using the standad selection
mechanism / the green lasso)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Connect (keyboard 2)<br>
  <br>
This method works well.&nbsp; You wil get used to it quickly and then
use it: select source &gt; 1 &gt; select&nbsp; target &gt; 2.&nbsp; It
goes fast.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <span class="heading2">Menu method</span><br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - select source neurons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - menu connect &gt; set as source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - select target<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - menu connect &gt; connect-source-target &gt; all
to all<br>
  <br><span class="heading2">Connection objects</span><br>
  <br>
For this and the next method you can set properties of connection
object using the &#8220;Set Connection Properties...&#8221; dialog.&nbsp; You can
make some very fancy and complex patterns of synaptic connection using
this.&nbsp; You can also add your own custom connection style.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="heading2">Simple Connect Method<br>
  <br>
  </span>
  <p><b>To connect a group of source nodes to one
target node</b>: Select one or more "source" nodes, then right-click
on a target neuron and select <span class="command">connect nodes</span>
from the pop-up menu. </p>
  <p><b>To connect a chain of nodes, one to another</b>:
Enter build mode, and single click in the following pattern: source,
target 1, target 1, target 2, target 2, target 3,...</p>

<br><span class="heading2">Selecting Weights via Connections</span><br>
Connections can be selected in 3 different ways via the selection methods laid out in the <a href="./buildingnets.html">Building and Editing Networks</a> page.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) By selecting the weights directly using the lasso etc. (shown below)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) By right clicking on a neuron and selecting <span class="command">Select &gt; Select incoming weights</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) By right clicking on a neuron and selecting <span class="command">Select &gt; Select outgoing weights</span>
<br><br>

<p class="heading">View Connections as a Weight Matrix<br><br>
</p>

<p>
<img style="width: 406px; height: 232px;" src="../../Images/weightmatrixviewer.png" align="right"></p><p align="left">The <span class="command">Show Weight Matrix</span>
option can be selected after right clicking any neuron or group of
neurons. The window itself represents the selected neurons as columns
and all source neurons to these neurons as rows. This equates all
selected neurons to target neurons as far as the weight matrix viewer
is concerned. All non-zero entries in the viewer represent the strength
of the connection between the neuron in the cell's row and the neuron
represented in its column. Likewise a zero entry represents that no
connection exists between the neurons designated by the row and coulumn
of the cell (though there can be a GUI connection with a value of zero
in rare cases).</p> <br><br>

<blockquote>
<span class="heading2">Weight Matrix Viewer Toolbar<br>
  <br>
  </span>
Additionally one can manipulate the strength of connections through the
weight matrix viewer. Clicking on a cell allows one to manipulate the
synaptic strength of the connection represented by the cell. One can
also randomize the values in the matrix, set values from a .csv file or
save values to a .csv file.<br>

<tbody>
<tr>

<td width="6%"><img src="../../Images/Rand.png" height="18" width="18"></td>
<td width="94%"> Pressing the Random button will uniformly randomize
the strength of all conections represented in the weight matrix viewer
between two numbers (default (1,-1))</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../../Images/Prefs.gif" height="18" width="18"></td>
<td>Pressing the Preferences button will allow one to set the upper and lower bounds on the viewer's randomize function.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../Images/Open.png" height="18" width="18"></td>
<td>Pressing the Open button allows one to open a .csv file and set the
values of the connections represented by the viewer to the values
specified in the file. Files representing matrices different from the
dimensions of the weight matrix shown in the viewer are unsuitable for
this task.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../Images/Save.png" height="18" width="18"></td>
<td>Pressing the Save button allows one to save the weight matrix as a .csv file, which can be opened later (as above).</td>
