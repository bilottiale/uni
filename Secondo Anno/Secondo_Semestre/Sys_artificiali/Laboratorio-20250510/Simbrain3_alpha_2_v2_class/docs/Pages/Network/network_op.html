<h1>Network Operation</h1>
<p>Each time the step button is pressed in the network panel--the
network moves forward in time by one iteration; that is, it takes on a
new state as a result of its current state. This is known as <a href="../Workspace/Update.html">updating</a> the network. However, as
one might imagine, there are multiple ways to go about this given a
construct as complex as an artificial neural network. To this end,
Simbrain includes two built in update types: buffered (default) and
priority-based. For more advanced users Simbrain also includes the
option of creating custom update methods. At the network level update
rules can be changed by going to File &gt; Network Preferences (or
"ctrl + ,"), and selecting the "logic" tab. From there the desired
update method for the network can be selected from a combo-box (see
below). <br>

<br>
The differences in these update methods can sometimes be subtle and
requires an understaning of how artificial neural networks are
simulated on a serial machine (and specifically in simbrain). To this
end: Artificial neural networks are essentially graphs, a collection of
nodes connected by vertices (the vertices are neurons and the
connections are synapses). The whole network has three lists: a list of
nodes, a list
of connections, and a list of networks ("subnetworks"). The connections
have references to the source and target nodes they connect. When a
network is updated the program goes through the list of neurons and
calls an update function internal to each one, and similarly with the
list of synapses. Before these values are actually changed they are
stored as a buffer within each network component. In this way, an
update method can be thought of as the specific way or order in which
buffered values are transformed into actual values. <br>
<br>
To reflect the fact that the network has been updated the "time" label
is updated as well.
<br>
<br>
<p><span class="heading"><span class="heading2">Buffered Update</span></span><br>
</p>
<p>Buffered update is the default update rule in Simbrain. For every
component of the network, the new value at time <i>t</i> is calculated
from the attribute values at <i>t - 1</i> and stored in the buffer. No
activation values are changed until every buffer as been calculated.
Then all activations are updated simultaneously based on their buffer
values.</p>
<p><span class="heading"><span class="heading2">Priority-Based Update</span></span><br>
</p>
<p>When using a priority based update, each node is assigned a priority
value. The lower this value, the higher the node's priority. Based on
this value all the network components are sorted into a queue. The
program addresses the head of this queue first calling the component's
update method and immediately setting its activation based on its
buffer value before moving on to the next component in the queue.
Components with the same priority are ordered arbitrarily in this queue.</p>
<p><span class="heading"><span class="heading2"><a name="CustomUpdate"></a>Custom
Update </span></span><br>
</p>
<p>For more advanced users the option exists to create a custom update
rule. Specifying a custom update rule is not availble in the GUI and
must be instantiated and defined either within a script (see <a href="../Scripting.html"> scripting</a>) or by editing the Simbrain
source code. </p>
