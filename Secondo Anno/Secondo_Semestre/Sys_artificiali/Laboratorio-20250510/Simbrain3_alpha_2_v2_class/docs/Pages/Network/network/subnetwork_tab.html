  <h1>Subnetwork Tab </h1>
  </p>
  <p>Subnetworks are marked off by a line surrounding them and a tab in the upper left corner, as in this example: </p>
  <p><img src="../../../Images/subnetwork.png" width="250" height="201"></p>
  <p> The tab is your interface with the subnetwork via the GUI. The text inside the tab displays what type of subnetwork it is. If you drag the tab, it will drag the entire subnetwork. By double-clicking on the tab, one can view the subnetwork's properties, while right clicking on it reveals  actions that are specific to the subnetwork. Here are some standard  operations available in the subnetwork tab (more specific actions and operations are described in the documentation for specific subnetork types). </p>
  <p class="heading">Delete</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Deletes the entire subnetwork. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Double Click</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If you double-click on the subnetwork tab it calls up that network's properties dialog. These properties depend on the subnetwork type. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Hide / Show Outline</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hides or reveals the outline drawn around the nodes of that subnetwork </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Randomize</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Unless otherwise noted, this simply calls the randomization method on each neuron, which sets it to a value from within its upper and lower bounds. In some cases it is overridden to perform other operations on the subnetwork as well. For example, backprop network randomization randomizes biases. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Set Properties</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Same as double clicking. Calls up the property dialog for that subnetwork type. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
