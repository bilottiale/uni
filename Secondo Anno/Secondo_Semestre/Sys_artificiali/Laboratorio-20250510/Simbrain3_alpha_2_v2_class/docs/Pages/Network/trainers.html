<h1>Trainers</h1>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">NOTE: The Trainer interface is
only partially functional in this release.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is one of the
main things being worked on for the final Simbrain 3 release.</span><br>
</p>
<p>Trainers can be used to train weights connecting layers of neurons
using various forms of supervised learning. There are currently three
trainers: backprop, Least-Mean-Squares (LMS)-iterative, and LMS-offline.<br>
</p>

<p>The trainer dialog can be used to set the weights connecting a given set of <a href="buildingnets.html#sourceTarget">source and target neurons</a>. &nbsp;
By using this dialog you can modify the weights connecting the source
and target neurons, or (for some training algorithms) also create the
weights.<br>

</p>


<p>To call up and use a trainer:</p>
<ol><li>Make sure you have an appropriate network to train.&nbsp; You <a href="buildingnets.html">build a network</a> by hand but one quick trick is to build a feed-forward network appropriate for&nbsp; pattern association tasksis to use the <a href="scripting.html#buildLayered">buildLayeredNetwork</a> script.<br>
</li>
  <li>Select the <a href="buildingnets.html#sourceTarget">source and target neurons</a> of this network.<br>
  </li>
<li>Open up a trainer by (1) right clicking and selecting&nbsp;<span class="command">Show Trainer</span>, or (2) going to the Edit menu and
selecting&nbsp;<span class="command">Show Trainer</span>.&nbsp; This
action has this chalk / chalkboard icon, <img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" alt="trainer icon" src="../../Images/Trainer.png">.</li><li>Select source and target data by clicking on the input data and
training data buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time you click these
buttons you will be prompted to select a .csv file with the relevant
data.&nbsp; Thereafter it will open that data up.&nbsp; You can edit the data if you like.</li>
  <li>Select what kind of training algorithm you want to use.&nbsp;
Some algorithms only work with some kinds of networks.&nbsp; For
example, LMS only works for 2-layer networks.&nbsp; The preference
button can be used to set parameters of the training session.<br>
  </li>
  <li>When you're ready to go, click on the "play" button for iterative
learning algorithms, or just click the "apply" button for non-iterative
algorithms.&nbsp; For iterative algorithms you will see the current
error as it changes in time.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Note that once you close a trainer object the link to the input and training data is lost.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>When you are done training, the source neurons should produce the correct target values.&nbsp; To test, you can open up a <a href="../Worlds/DataWorld/DataWorld.html">data world</a>, load the input data in to that data world, and <a href="../Workspace/Couplings.html">couple</a> it to the source neurons, to see if it worked.<br>
