<h1>Sparse Connection<br>
</h1><br>
<p>Sparse connectivity gets its name from the concept of a sparse
matrix i.e. a matrix primarily populated by zeros. Likewise, since a
given set of connections is generally represented as a "weight matrix"
this corresponds to there being a relatively small number of
connections between two sets of neurons. Specifically, the sparse
connection panel allows users to specify how well connected two sets of
neurons are in terms of a percentage of the total possible connections
(0% being no connections and 100% being the same as <a href="./alltoall.html">connecting every source neuron to every target neuron</a>).
Technically, this means that sparse is capable of creating so called
"dense" connectivity, since any percent is possible (so long as there
are enough neurons). It should be noted that sparse connects sets of
neurons randomly (i.e. if one has 4 source neurons and 4 target neurons
and desires 50% connectivity 8 synapses will be generated connecting
random source neurons to random target neurons), and futhermore it is
impossible to designate or guarantee than any particular connection
will be generated. In the aforementioned example there is no guarantee
that there will be a connection between say source neuron 2 and target
neuron 3, unless the percent connectivity is set to 100%. Sparse
connection does guarantee that the number of synapses generated will be
the closest possible approximation of the percent connectivity
specified (since any percentage of possible connections must be an
integer value). Parameters relating to inhibitory and excitatory
attributes of these connections can be adjusted from the sparse panel
via the <a href="./excitatoryinhibitoryproperties.html">excitatory/inhibitory properties sub-panel.</a></p>
