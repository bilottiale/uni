<h1>Projection Overview</h1>
  
<p>Projection components are instances of a program called <a href="http://hisee.sourceforge.net">HiSee</a>. HiSee is a high dimensional visualizer. As a neural net operates its state travels along a path in its state space which typically has many dimensions. Hisee can take the collection of states which are visited by a neural net and project them down into two dimensions so that many of their geometric and topological properties are preserved. This gives users of Simbrain a way to visualize the behavior of the network component. More information about HiSee is available at the HiSee website: <a href="http://hisee.sourceforge.net"> http://hisee.sourceforge.net </a>.</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="../../Images/Gauges.gif" height="314" width="292"></p>

<p align="left">This gauge represents the states (patterns of activity across the nodes of the network) that have occurred in a network with 40 neurons. Each green dot corresponds to one of those states. The red dot represents the current state. For the most part, points that are close to each other in the gauge correspond to states that close to each other in the network's 40-dimensional state space. </p>

<p align="left">When Simbrain is running users can add one or more gauges windows, each of which projects some subset of the network's state variables to two dimensions. This allows users to independently study different aspects of the network component. For example, one gauge might represent the activity at the input nodes of a network, another might represent activity at the hidden nodes, another might represent the aggregate activity of the entire network, and another might represent the changing values of the network's weights as it learns.</p>

<p class="heading">What the Dots Represent </p>

<p>Each "dot" in the gauge represents a state of the network. When a gauge is first opened, there are no dots, since no state information has been sent to the gauge yet. With each update of the network, state information is sent to the gauge which is then displayed as a red dot. The set of dots that appear in the gauge window represent the states that have been visited by the associated network since the gauge was added. This representation of the history of a network's activity allows for the user to understand and analyze the network's behavior. As the network is updated the user can watch new dots appear as new states arise.</p>

<p align="left">The gauge below represents the states that have occurred in a network with 20 neurons. Each dot corresponds to one of those states, where the red dot is current state, and the blue dots are all previous states (colors can be changed in the <a href="../Gauge/preferences.html">Preferences Dialog</a>). Points that are close to each other in the gauge correspond to patterns of activity that are similar. One can linger over a data point to reveal a tooltip that displays which high-dimensional position they correspond to.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/Gauges.gif" height="250" width="233"></p>

<p>When a gauge is created by pressing a network's <em>Gauge</em> button, they, by default, represent the activity of  <em>all</em> the neurons across the network, though they can be set to represent any subset of the neurons of a neural network. Gauges can also be used to represent weight strengths. </p>

<p><span class="heading">Pan and Zoom</span> </p>

<p>The gauge display is currently 2-dimensional. It is based on the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/piccolo/">Piccolo</a> zoomable user interface (ZUI), which allows users to pan and zoom and graphical data. When <a href="../Gauge/menu.html#Autoscale">autoscale</a> in the preference menu is turned off, you can pan the visible data by left-dragging (dragging the mouse while holding the left-mouse button down), and you can zoom in or out on data by right-dragging (dragging the mouse while holding the right button down). </p>

<h1>Projection Methods</h1>

<p>There are numerous ways to project high dimensional data to lower dimensions. The projection menu in the gauge allows one to switch projections and thereby compare the way neural network data look under different projections. </p>

<p class="heading"><a name="Coordinate"></a>Coordinate Projection</p>

<blockquote><p>This is perhaps the simplest possible projection technique. If one has a list of datapoints with 40 components each, coordinate projection to two-dimensions simply ignores all but two of these components, which are then used to display the data in two-space.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="heading"> Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</p>

<blockquote><p>PCA builds on coordinate projection by making use of the "principal axes" of the dataset. The principal axes of an object are the directions in space about which the object is most balanced or evenly spaced. PCA selects the two principal axes along which the dataset is the most spread out and projects the data onto these two axes.</p>

<p><a name="Sammon"></a><span class="heading">Sammon map</span></p>

<blockquote><p>The Sammon map is an iterative technique for making interpoint distances in the low-dimensional projection as close as possible to the interpoint distances in the high-dimensional object. Two points close together in the high-dimensional space should appear close together in the projection, while two points far apart in the high dimensional space should appear far apart in the projection. By minimizing an error function between the high and low dimensional sets of interpoint distances, the Sammon map does its best to preserve these distances in the projection. This iterative procedure can be watched in the gauge by loading a dataset and pressing the "play" button on the interface.<br>

<span class="heading2">Note</span>: Before Sammon Mapping is used, it is useful to <em>Randomize</em>, <img src="../../Images/Rand.gif">, the data points, as overlapping points cause the algorithm to blow up. One would run the Sammon Mapping process <strong>after</strong> data points have been developed by PCA or Coordinate Projection. </p>

The bigger the step size is the faster the projection algorithm will run but if the step size is too large the projected image will explode. One can generally experiment with different step sizes to get the right one. If iteration is progressing very slowly, one can just try something large, like 100, 300, or even 1000. If the dataset "explodes" (in which case everything in the display may contract to a point), press the randomize button to start over. Tip: A step size of a little less than 1 is good for objects with about a dozen points while a step size in the hundreds is good for objects with hundreds of points. </p></blockquote>

Even if a new point is not exactly the same as some other point in the set, it may be "close enough" to be considered the same point. This field allows one to set a tolerance level for deciding whether two points are the same. If "2" is specified in this field, for example, then any new point within a radius of 2 of some existing point will not be added to the dataset. <span class="heading2">Note</span>: Repeated points are allowed in the low-dimensional dataset; this field only applies to the high-dimensional data. </p>
  
<p><span class="heading2">Purturbation Factor:</span> the distance the program will move coincident low dimensional points before running the Sammon mapping algorithm.

<h1>Adding Points</h1>

<p>In some cases it is useful to be able to add new points to an existing dataset without running the projection method on the whole dataset again. Methods exist for quickly adding new data points based on data that have already been projected. These methods work best when a certain amount of data has already been collected and projected using, for example, PCA or the Sammon map. Note that these methods will rarely be applied in most uses of Simbrain.</p>

<p class="heading">Nearest Neighbor Subspace Method</p>

<blockquote><p>(<span class="heading2">1</span>) Takes each new point and determines the three points in the current data set that are closest to it.</p>

<p>(<span class="heading2">2</span>) Finds the projection of the new point into the two-dimensional subspace
that contains the three nearest neighbors in the high-dimensional space.</p>

<p>(<span class="heading2">3</span>) Uses the three nearest neighbors and their corresponding points in the
low dimensional dataset to find an affine map that approximates the full projection method (whichever one is currently being used).</p>

<p>(<span class="heading2">4</span>) Applies the affine map to the new datapoint.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="heading"><a name="Triangulate"></a>Triangulate</p>

<blockquote><p>The Triangulate method takes each new point and determines which two points in the current data set are closest to it. Then, if possible, it will place the projected image of the new point so that its distance from the projected image of its two nearest neighbors is the same as it was in the high dimensional space. When it is not possible to project the point such that its distance to its two nearest neighbors is preserved, then the projected image of the new point will be placed on a line connecting the projected image of its two nearest neighbors. In this case the position of the projected image of the new point on this line is determined by the relative sizes of the distances between the new point and its two nearest neighbors in the current data set. </p></blockquote>

<p class="heading">Refresh</p>

<blockquote><p>Data points are not added using any special algorithm. Rather, when new data points arrive, the current projection algorithm is re-run on the entire updated dataset (if the current projection algorithm is an iterative algorithm like the Sammon map then coordinate projection is used by default). PCA tends to be useful in refresh mode, for it is relatively fast but also takes into consideration the entire dataset. For better results using coordinate projection, <em>Automatically Select Most Variant Dimensions</em> can be used.</p>
