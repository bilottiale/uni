<h1>Building and Editing Networks<br>
</h1>

<br>
<p>Network
editing in Simbrain is modeled on a familiar "draw" interface which
involves creating screen elements, copying, and pasting.</p>

<p class="heading"><a name="NewNode"></a>Creating nodes. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Creating a node:</span> Nodes are created
by pressing "P" or by pressing the new node button <img src="../../Images/AddNeuron.png" height="18" width="18"> in the toolbar.
Any new nodes will be created at the last position clicked on-screen. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Creating a line of nodes:</span>
Repeatedly pressing "P" or the new node buttuon results in a line of
nodes being created beginning at the last clicked position.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Creating specific types of neurons:</span>
By default, new nodes are <a href="./neuron/linear.html">Linear</a>.
The default node type cannot
currently be changed, though this is planned. To create a node of a
specific type, simply create a new node, right click the node, then go
to "Edit 1 Selected Neuron". From there one can select any neuron type
in Simbrain from a dropdown menu.</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Creating many nodes:</span> To create many nodes at once one can go to <span class="command">Insert &gt; Add Neurons</span>
and instantly create an arbitrary number of neurons specified in the
Add Neurons window. Upon closing windows requesting information on the
type and layout of the neurons will appear. Information on laying out
groups of neurons can be found on the <a href="./layouts.html">Layouts</a> page. Alternately, to create many nodes of a specific type one can: <br></p><blockquote> Create a node, set its type (as specified above), and then copy and paste repeatedly.<br> &nbsp; OR<br> Create many default nodes, select all of them with the cursor (see <b>Selecting Nodes and Weights</b> below), right click any of them, and change their type from: <span class="command">Edit <b>N</b> Selected Neurons</span>, where N is the number of selected neurons.</blockquote> 
  <p><span class="heading2">Creating networks or groups of nodes:</span>
Subnets are created using <span class="command">Insert &gt; Add Network</span>.
<a href="./subnetwork.html">Subnetworks</a> and small groups of neurons can be created, copied, and
repeatedly pasted to quickly create many sets of similar elements.
</p><br>

</blockquote><p class="heading"><a name="SelectNodes"></a>Selecting nodes and weights<br>
</p>
<p> Neurons and weights can be selected so that operations can be
performed on the selected group of items (e.g., randomizing selected
items, adjusting them up or down, etc.). Selecting neurons and weights
is important, because many Simbrain operations apply to selected sets
of weights and/or nodes. The selection interface basically works the
way most computer drawing programs work. Use the left-click button to
"lasso" or "rubberband" screen items. Once some items are selected, you
can hold down the shift key and single-click to fine tune your
selection. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Selection mode</span>: All
selection operations must be done in selection mode, the default mode,
which is entered by pressing "S" or the selection button <img src="../../Images/Arrow.gif" height="18" width="18">.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Lasso</span>: Left-click and drag the lasso
around screen items you want to select. As items are selected a box
appears around them.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Single click</span>: Single left-click on
nodes and weights to select individual screen items. Zooming in on
items can facilitate this.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Shift key </span>:
Once some items are selected, you can hold down the shift key to add
more items to your selection. Hold down Shift while lassoing to add or
remove groups items; hold down Shift while single-clicking to add or
remove single items. </p>
</blockquote>


<p class="heading"><a name="SettingPref"></a>Setting Properties</p>
<p>Some detailed properties are set using a dialog box. Other
properties, e.g. activation values for neurons and strengths for
weights, can be set using keyboard and toolbar commands.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Calling set properties dialog:</span>
Select the neurons or weights you want to change and:</p>
  <p>1) double-click on of the selected items<br>
2) right-click and select <span class="command">set properties</span>
in the popup menu<br>
3) select <span class="command">network &gt; edit &gt; set neurons</span>
or <span class="command">network &gt; edit &gt; set weights</span></p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Setting properties of multiple objects</span>.
Select the objects you want to modify. If you select both weights and
neurons, which preference dialog comes up depends on which kind of item
you click on. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Set activation values</span>:
The activation value (and hence color) of neurons and the excitatory or
inhibitory strength (and hence color and size) of weights can be
manually adjusted. To do so, select one or more neurons and weights
(both can be adjusted at the same time), and press the up and down
arrow keys to increase or decrease these values. The amount increased
or decreased is set by the "increment" field. Right and left arrow keys
can also be used to increase or decrease these value. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Clearing and randomizing values</span>:
Note that while screen items are selected, neuron values can also be
set to zero by pressing "C" on the keyboard (weight values are not then
set to zero, because this is equivalent to deleting them, which can be
done with the delete key). Pressing "R" will randomize all selected
screen items, neurons and weights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="heading">Moving Nodes </p>
<p>Simply left click and drag the selected items, as you would a window
or any other screen item. Groups of items can be moved by selecting and
left-click dragging them. For fine tuning, users can also use the arrow
keys (with Shift held down) to "nudge" selected items. </p>
<p class="heading"><a name="CopyPaste"></a>Smart copy and paste<br>
</p>
<p>Selected items can be copied, cut, and paste similarly to the way
they are on most contemporary GUI's. Lasso select groups of items, then
fine tune your selection using SHIFT to add or remove items. Simbrain
will automatically select all valid subnetworks (all nodes and all
selected connections which couple selected nodes; i.e. "free-floating"
connections will not be selected). </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Copy, copy, and paste in one of the following ways </p>
  <p>1) Use standard shortcuts: control-C (copy), control-X (cut),
control-V (paste).<br>
2) Use the network menu and select copy, cut, or paste. <br>
3) Right-click on one of the selected items and select copy or cut</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smart copy/paste: Copy neurons, paste, move, and re-paste, and the
new paste&#8217;s follow the rule. In this way you can quickly build big
networks.</p>
