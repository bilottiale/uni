  </p><h1>Spiking Networks</h1>
  <p>Several
neuron types produce discrete "spikes," that is, instantaneous firing
events. When they do, the neuron and the lines leading out from it (the
"axon") turn a different color (by default yellow). This framework is
used to create more biologically realistic simulations. In these
neurons, the activation--the number in the neuron--is interpreted as a
voltage potential, and when that number passes a threshold the neuron
"fires," and typically the activation then drops to a lower value. </p>
  <p>Currently two neurons are spiking neurons:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="neuron/integrateAndFire.html">Integrate and Fire</a><br>
      <a href="neuron/izhikevich.html">Izhikivech</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The
question arises with spiking neurons of how this discrete "event" can
be interpreted by the neurons it connects to. This is handled using a
special interface in all synapses fanning out from the spiking neuron.
When you double click on one of these synapses, the dialog is as it
normally would be for a synapse of that type, but an additional tab is
added, a "spike response" tab. This tab determines how spike events
will be converted into activation. In general, one of these synapses is
referred to as a <a href="synapse/spikeResponder.html">spike responder</a>.</p><br>

<p>Simbrain allows interaction between connectionist type units and
more biologically realistic model elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Weights"
mean different things in the two contexts.For incoming neurons it's not
too hard.&nbsp; It's just weighted input (incoming activation x weight
value) It's stranger in the "outgoing" direction. To deal with the
situation, we associate weights attaching to a spiking neuron with a
"Spike responder" that converts weighted input (incoming activation x
weight value) into an input current.<br>
