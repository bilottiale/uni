The Network Preferences dialog can be opened by going to File &gt;
Network Preferences within a network window. The dialog offers ways to
alter the graphical, logical, and other miscellaneous properties of the
network window and/or the network within that window.&nbsp;

<p class="heading">Graphics</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">Color:</span>
allows the user to change the color of the various components within
the network frame. The colors that can be changed are: Background,
Line, Hot node, Cool node, Excitatory weight, Inhibitory weight, Lasso,
Selection and Spiking. The current color selection is indicated by the
color box located between the combo box and the "Set" button. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="heading2">Background color</span>: is the color of the network background.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Cool node color:</span> is the color of a neuron that has an activation level less than zero.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Excitatory weight color:</span> is the color of the synapse that has a strength  greater than zero.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Hot node color:</span> is the color of a neuron that has an activation level greater than zero.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Inhibitory weight color:</span> is the color of the synapse that has a strength  less than zero.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Lasso color:</span> is the color of the line that appears when dragging the mouse to select neurons and weights. </p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Line color:</span> is the color of the lines that connect neurons.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Selection color:</span> is the color of the box that surrounds items that have been selected. </p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Spiking color:</span> is the color of a neuron's outline (and outgoing synapse lines) when it spikes.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">Weight size max/min:</span>
sets the maximum and minimum size a weight can be. This option only
changes the graphical size of the weight and has no bering on how the
weight behaves.</p>
	<p><span class="heading2">Show Subnet Outline:</span> toggles subnetwork outlines on and off.
</p>
	<p><span class="heading2">Show time: </span> toggles display of iterations/time at the bottom of the network frame.
</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="heading">Logic</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">Round off neuron values:</span> if selected will round neuron values as per the precision set by the user.</p>
      <p><span class="heading2">Precision of round-off:</span>
determines to what precision neuron values will be rounded off. Option
is only available when "Round off neuron values" is enabled. </p>
 <p><span class="heading2">Network Update Method:</span> determines the update rule used to update the network. Only preset options are available in this menu (see: <a href="../Scripting.html"> scripting</a> for detailed information on how to implement custom update rules).
  </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><span class="heading">Misc.</span></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">Nudge amount:</span>
is the amount of indent to be used when indenting network files. This
option is only valid when "Indent network files" is selected. </p>
