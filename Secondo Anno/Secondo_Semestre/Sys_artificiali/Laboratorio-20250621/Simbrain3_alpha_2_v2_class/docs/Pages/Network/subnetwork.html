<h1>Subnetworks</h1>
<p>Subnetworks are used when special rules are required that go beyond
what is available using the <a href="network_op.html">standard update</a>
method. For example, some networks must have their nodes updated in a
special order, or must have their synapses updated in a way which
requires more information than is available locally to the synapses.
Subnetworks are distinguished by being surrounded by a gray line, with
a special tab in the upper left-hand corner: </p>
<p>The upper-left tab, or "<a href="network/subnetwork_tab.html">subnetwork
tab</a>," is the your interface with the subnetwork and its properties.
</p>
<p>Subnetworks are created either by using the <span class="command">insert
menu</span> in the network window, or right clicking and using the <span class="command">new network</span>
submenu. Neurons and synapses cannot currently be added inside
subnetworks, though subnets can be connected to anything outside of
themselves. </p>
<p>Connections can exist between any two nodes, at whatever level of
the subnetwork hierarchy. Subnetworks (networks within networks) are
themselves network objects, with lists of neurons and nodes, and
perhaps additional subnetworks. If a subnetwork itself has subnetworks,
those are not shown as such in the GUI. <br>
</p>
<p><span class="heading">Subnetwork Tab</span><br>
</p>
<p> The tab is your interface with the subnetwork via the GUI. The text
inside the tab displays what type of subnetwork it is. If you drag the
tab, it will drag the entire subnetwork. By double-clicking on the tab,
one can view the subnetwork's properties, while right clicking on it
reveals actions that are specific to the subnetwork. Here are some
standard operations available in the subnetwork tab (more specific
actions and operations are described in the documentation for specific
subnetork types). </p>
<p class="heading"><span class="heading2">Delete</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Deletes the entire subnetwork. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="heading"><span class="heading2">Double Click</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If
you double-click on the subnetwork tab it calls up that network's
properties dialog. These properties depend on the subnetwork type. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="heading"><span class="heading2">Hide / Show Outline</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hides or reveals the outline drawn around the nodes of that
subnetwork </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="heading"><span class="heading2">Randomize</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Unless
otherwise noted, this simply calls the randomization method on each
neuron, which sets it to a value from within its upper and lower
bounds. In some cases it is overridden to perform other operations on
the subnetwork as well. For example, backprop network randomization
randomizes biases. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="heading heading2">Set Properties</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Same as double clicking. Calls up the
property dialog for that subnetwork type. </p>
