  <p></p><h1>Synapses</h1>
  
  
  <p>Synapses,
also known as weights, are represented in Simbrain by a colored
semicircle. The size of the semicircle is proportional to how far the
synaptic strength is between 0 and its upper or lower bound. The exact
strength can be determined by lingering over a synapse or double
clicking on it. The color of a synapse represents whether the strength
is: greater than 0, red; less than 0, blue; or equal to 0, white. The
last case represents, as it were, the absence of a weight. These
conventions can be adjusted in the <a href="network_prefs.html">preference dialog.</a>&nbsp;</p><p class="heading">Setting Synapse Properties </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To set a single synapse, double click or right click on it and select <span class="command">set properties</span>. Since synapses are relatively small, you can either zoom in or lasso the synapse of interest.</p>
  <p>To
set multiple synapses, select more than one synapse, and either double
click on one of the synapses you have selected, or select <span class="command">set properties</span>
from the popup or network menu. A dialogue box pertaining to multiple
synapses will appear. If the selected neurons are of different synapse
types, only the common properties appear. Consistent properties are
shown as normal, while inconsistent properties have "..." in the text
box. Any changes, including changes to the fields where parameters have
been marked as inconsistent, are applied to all of the selected neurons.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="heading">Common Synapse Properties </p>
<p>These are properties common to all synapses, regardless of type. All
of them have some reflection in the GUI interface, but some of them <em>only</em>
matter to the GUI interface (e.g. increment). For some synapses, upper
bound and lower bound does not have a significant role other than to
limit how larget the graphical representation of the synapse can be. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Strength</span>: The strength
is how "strong" this synapse is. This is represented by the size of the
weight. Once a synapse has been selected, strength can be incremented
by the up and down arrows or can be randomized. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Increment</span>:
The increment field sets the amount that a synapse is incremented when
it is manually adjusted. For example, if increment is set to .1, then
each time the up arrow is pressed the synapse will increase its
strength by .1. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2"><a name="upperbound"></a>Upper Bound </span>:
This field plays different roles depending on the type of the synapse,
but in general it determines the maximum strength of a weight. It also
determines the range of colors which a neuron can take on. This, along
with the lower bound field, determines the bounds of randomization.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2"><a name="lowerbound"></a>Lower Bound </span>:
This field, like the upper bound, plays different roles depending on
the type of the synapse, but in general it determines the minimum
strength of a weight. It also determines the range of colors which a
neuron can take on. This, along with the upper bound, determines the
bounds of randomization.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Delay</span>:
A positive integer that delays how many iterations, or time-steps, must
occur before the pre-synaptic signal, or the activation of the
pre-synaptic neuron, is delivered.</p>
